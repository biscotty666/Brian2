## Dripping Text


### Instructions and Hints

NB. A resolution size of 300 is important for text but a reduced resolution in this case (75 was suggested) will speed the processing. In this example we keep 300.

1. Create a new file and set/fill the background color (light color)
2. Add texture with Filter/Artistic/Apply Canvas
3. The tutorial uses Fugaz One font, 500px, black to type "Drip"
4. Select Drip Layer, Alpha to Selection
5. Add image to  Document
6. Adjust layer positioning to get nice colors behind the text
7. Add alpha channel to image layer
8. Invert selection and delete to leave only the image in the text
9. Deselect
10. Turn off text layer
11. From top layer, Layer to Image Size
12. Use Warp Transform, defaults okay but change brush size
13. Click and drag to mix colors 
14. Can start on the outside and push in or inside and push out

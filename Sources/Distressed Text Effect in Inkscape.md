# Distressed Text Effect in Inkscape

## Notes

1. Create text
2. Object to path
3. Ungroup ?
4. Roughen edges
	1. With node tool add nodes (double-click)
	2. "Roughen" edges with Extensionts - Modify Path - Jitter Nodes
		1. Just use a little, ie. 1.0 1.0
5. Add vector texture
		We want to create an inner area to apply the pattern so
		1. Duplicate and change to green to make visible
		2. Path/Dynamic offset to make smaller (I had to fiddle a bit to make the little square appear at the top)
		3. Path-Object to path
		4. Drag svg vector texture over image
		5. Shft-click on inner letter Path/Intersection
		6. Shft-click on letter Path/difference

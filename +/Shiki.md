## Shiki Syntax Highlighter

**Shiki**, on the other hand, is a TextMate grammar-powered syntax highlighter. It generates colored tokens, so there is no additional CSS needed. Since it has great grammar support, the generated colors are very accurate, just like what you will see in VS Code. Shiki also comes with [a bunch of built-in themes](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/master/docs/themes.md). The downside of Shiki is that it also requires TextMate themes (compatible with VS Code theme) to do the highlighting, which can be a bit harder to customize.^[[Highlighters | Slidev](https://sli.dev/custom/highlighters.html)]

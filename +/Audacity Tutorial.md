Recommended 6/6/6
Noise reduction >=12 produces harsh effect
Smoothing: use 3 or lower for music, 6 is best for voice

1. Noise reduction
	1. Select section with noise and Get Noise Profile
	2. Select entire track and go back to the Noise Reduction dialog
2. Equalization - Filter curve EQ
3. Compressor - check "Based on peaks"
4. Normalize - using -3 allows headroom for later processing

The human ear hears frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz

Treble boost: bring down from 9 to 6 to avoid harshness
Drop down after 16 k (rarely more above that)
Low rolloff for speech: Roll off from 80 Hz instead of 100. Anything lower is probably noise and not the voice.
Treble boost must be done manually after Low Rolloff move up 6 db from 4k to 5k, drop after 16k

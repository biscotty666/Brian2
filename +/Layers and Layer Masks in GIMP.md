## Layers and Layer Masks in GIMP


### Notes

GIMP allows you to edit in three channels, __Red__, __Green__ and __Blue__.

A fourth channel, the __alpha__ channel can be added to edit transparency

With the background color set to black the eraser tool merely paints black on the image.

When the alpha channel is turned on the layer name in the dialog becomes bold.

Now the eraser reveals the checkerboard pattern which indicates transparency of this layer and all visible layers below.

Once the alpha channel is added to the background layer, all future layers will have the channel automatically.

Transparency can be full, partial or fully opaque

The opacity of the entire layer can be changed in the _Layers_ dialog.

Sometimes I am no longer able to edit (erase in this case) and I don't know what to do except create a new image.

You can drag an entire image onto another document or you can drag just a layer.

If the eraser isn't working make sure that the alpha channel is active.

To see parts of a layer outside the image boundary `View->Show All`

If an alpha channel is locked you can draw on opaque pixels but not on areas of the layer with only transparency. If you drag and drop a color (bucket fill) it will not add the color to the transparent area.

`Shift-Click` on the visibility icon in the layers dialog to hide/unhide all the other layers.

The transform lock icon (right of the visibility icon) is not a lock per se. It "joins" or links multiple layers so that a transformation on one layer affects all the linked layers.

A layer mask can be "merged" with Apply Layer Mask (not non-destructive).

Layer Masks can be applied to groups.

Use Mask to Selection to copy a Layer Mask from one layer to another.
